            <h4>Problem Overview</h4>
            <p>
                According to the UNHRC, at the end of 2022, <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/us/about-unhcr/who-we-are/figures-glance#:~:text=How%20many%20refugees%20are%20there,under%20the%20age%20of%2018.">
                <em>108.4 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced</em> because of "persecution, conflict, human rights violations, or events seriously
                    disturbing public order"</a>; that accounts for roughly 1/74 of the entire Earth's population. The gravity of the refugee situation in the world 
                    became even clearer to me after February of 2022, when my grandparents needed to flee bombing in Ukraine and beceame refugees in neighboring
                    Poland. During our daily Skype calls, they always told us about how lost they felt, both emotionally in terms of leaving their home and community,
                    and mentally because of not knowing how to access the resources they needed, and even what resources to access in the first place. That's why I 
                    want to create an app that will connect refugee communities together, both by bringing them the resources they need and by providing a sense of 
                    community.

        <section class="Information-Problems">
            <h4>Information Technology Problems</h4>
            <p>
                There currently exist several barriers related to information technology that prevent refugees from being able to adjust to their current circumstances.
                <section class="list">
                    <ul>
                        Language barriers, limited internet, and lack of knowledge on resources can make adjusting hard and increase the spread of misinformation potentially damaging to the lives of refugees.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        Being a refugee is a complex legal matter and can easily get somebody in trouble if they are not properly navigating all procedures related to being a refugee, which can lead to legal battles and even exploitation by others.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        Trauma among refugee populations leads to prevalent mental health issues that can be difficult to address because of sociolinguistic/cultural barriers and lack of proper materials.
                    </ul>

        <section class="Existing-Attempts">
            <h4>Existing Solutions</h4>
            <p>Some sample initiatives made for combatting the refugee crisis include: 
                <section class="list">
                    <ul>
                        <em><a href="https://refaid.com/">Ref Aid:</a></em> Connects refugees with aid organizations.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <em><a href="https://www.tarjimly.org/">Tarjimly:</em></a> Connects refugees with voluntary translators.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <em><a href="https://kiron.ngo/">Kiron Open Higher Education</em>: </a>Connects refugees with online learning platforms.
                    </ul>
                </section>
                While these apps are all great in isolation, the fact that task a refugee needs to do (e.g. find aid, find translators, find education) is on a separate app only piles onto the list of tasks that refugees need to do, which can be very stressful for refugees. Furthermore, these apps are often conducted by outsiders with the purpose of helping "outsiders" e.g. (refugees), which can be very intimidating for refugees because it seems that all the help they can get will be from outside their community; this problematic since community provides solace and complete isolation from the community when seeking help can be mentally challenging. These apps also do not focus on ultimately uniting refugee communities together, which can be more helpful for refugees than anything. 
                </p>
                <p>


                Thus, I want to devise an app that not only connects refugees with the resources they need all in one place (e.g. aid, translators, education, transportation, legal help, etc) but also allows for refugee communities to communicate with one another to (a.) get the help they need, and (b.) support each other, both through being each other's emotional support and by sharing funny posts online.

        App Description
    </h2>

    <section class="App-Description">
        <h3>User on the App</h3>
        <section class="App-Users">
            <p>
                The users of this app will eventually be refugee communities around the world, but the initial phase of this app will include a variety of refugee communities all in the Seattle area, including Ukrainians, Somalis, Afghans, and Syrians. This app will seek to empower minority communities since refugee communities are often marginalized in socierty; creating a safe space for refugee communities is the main motivation behind this app.

        <section class="Interactive-Features">
            <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
            <p>
                This app will contain many interactive features, including (but not limited to):
                <section class="list">
                    <li>The ability to join subgroups within the app based on common interests (e.g. gardening, education, etc)</li>
                    <li>The ability to find a legal representative based on certain criteria (e.g. gender, languages, etc)</li>
<<<<<<<<< Temporary merge branch 1
                    <li>The ability to find nearest aid organizations and resources (e.g. where good discounts on food are, where to find free/discounted products, etc)</li>
=========
                    <li>The ability to see a map with markers representing locations such as healthcare facilities, education centers, employment agencies, legal aid offices, and community organizations. Users can tap on these markers to access detailed information about each location, including contact details, hours of operation, and services offered. The map can also provide navigation assistance, guiding users to their desired destinations using GPS.</li>

        <section class="Information-Viewed">
            <h3>Information Users Can View</h3>
            <p>
                The information that users will be viewing will be a combination of content that viewers on the app create (e.g. community posts or posts within specific subgroups) as well as resources that are connected to the app, such as resources relating to legal services, aid nearby, discounts, educational classes e.g. language classes, and more. We will use many resources from <a href="https://www.rescue.org/united-states/seattle-wa">the International Rescue Committee in Seattle</a> as well as other local resources specific to certain refugee communities, such as the <a href="https://uaws.org/resources-for-ukrainian-refugees/">Ukrainian Association of Washington State</a> for resources particular to Ukrainian refugees. We will also vet particular legal counsel and have them be linked online as a valuable resource.

        <section class="How-App-Helps">
            <h3>How This App Helps</h3>
            <p>
                This app will help connect refugee communities together by providing a safe space where they can get all the resources and emotional support they need. Because other social media apps often contain misinformation about refugee situations or even hate speech towards refugees, this app is essential towards providing a space in which refugees can feel comfortable communicating with one another, knowing that they will not be attacked online. This app also helps refugees be able to identify where other refugees live near them so they can make friends and have someone to reach out to when they need help. By connecting valuable resources and community support, this app will help ensure that refugees feel safe in and connected to their communities, relieving some of the burdens of being displaced.
